# Fleek SDK Guide for Validators
By CryptoGOD

## Introduction

Fleek is a decentralized web infrastructure platform that simplifies the deployment and management of web services on Web3. The Fleek SDK (Software Development Kit) is a powerful tool that allows developers and validators to interact with Fleek's services programmatically. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the Fleek SDK, with a focus on its applications for validators.

To begin using the Fleek SDK, you'll need to install it via npm. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

```
npm install @fleekxyz/sdk
```
## Basic Configuration

After installation, you need to configure the SDK with your Fleek credentials. You can obtain these credentials from your Fleek account.

```
const Fleek = require('@fleekxyz/sdk');

// Initialize Fleek SDK
const fleek = new Fleek({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
});
```

Replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_API_SECRET with your actual Fleek credentials.

## Fleek SDK Overview

### Key Features

The Fleek SDK offers several key features that are essential for validators:

- Programmatic Deployment: Automate the deployment of websites and applications to Fleek's decentralized infrastructure.
  
- Storage Management: Manage files and data stored on IPFS and other decentralized storage solutions.
  
- Site Management: Control and configure site settings, including custom domains and SSL certificates.
  
## Core Functionalities

### Authentication

Before performing any actions, authenticate using the provided credentials.

```
fleek.auth().then(response => {
  console.log('Authenticated:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Authentication failed:', error);
});
```

## Deployment

Validators can deploy websites or applications using the following method:

```
const deployParams = {
  bucket: 'my-app',
  key: 'index.html',
  data: '<html><body>Hello, World!</body></html>',
};

fleek.deploy(deployParams).then(response => {
  console.log('Deployment successful:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Deployment failed:', error);
});
```

## Storage Management

Manage files within your Fleek account, such as uploading and retrieving files from IPFS.

### Upload a File

```
const uploadParams = {
  bucket: 'my-app',
  key: 'my-file.txt',
  data: 'Hello, Fleek!',
};

fleek.uploadFile(uploadParams).then(response => {
  console.log('File uploaded:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('File upload failed:', error);
});
```

### Retrieve a File
```

const retrieveParams = {
  bucket: 'my-app',
  key: 'my-file.txt',
};

fleek.getFile(retrieveParams).then(response => {
  console.log('File content:', response.data);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('File retrieval failed:', error);
});
```
### Site Management

Manage your sites, including creating, updating, and deleting sites.

### Create a Site

```
const siteParams = {
  bucket: 'my-site',
  name: 'My Awesome Site',
  framework: 'React',
  git: {
    branch: 'main',
    repository: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git',
  },
};

fleek.createSite(siteParams).then(response => {
  console.log('Site created:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Site creation failed:', error);
});
```

### Delete a Site

```
fleek.deleteSite({siteId: 'my-site-id'}).then(response => {
  console.log('Site deleted:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Site deletion failed:', error);
});
```

## Advanced Usage

### Integrating with CI/CD Pipelines

The Fleek SDK can be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments whenever there are changes in your codebase. Use it within scripts or as part of your GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tools.

### Custom Domain Management

Validators managing multiple sites can use the SDK to programmatically manage custom domains.

```
const domainParams = {
  siteId: 'my-site-id',
  domain: 'mycustomdomain.com',
};

fleek.addCustomDomain(domainParams).then(response => {
  console.log('Custom domain added:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Custom domain addition failed:', error);
});
```

### Event Triggers

Fleek allows setting up triggers that can execute certain actions when specific events occur, such as a successful deployment.

## Best Practices for Validators

- Automate Regular Deployments: Utilize CI/CD pipelines to automate regular deployments, reducing the manual workload and potential errors.
  
- Monitor Deployment Status: Implement logging and monitoring to track the status of your deployments and quickly identify any issues.
  
- Secure Your Credentials: Store your API keys and secrets securely. Consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management service.
  
## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

- Authentication Errors: Ensure that your API key and secret are correct and have the necessary permissions.
  
- Deployment Failures: Check your internet connection and verify that your deployment parameters are correctly configured.
  
- File Not Found: Ensure that the correct bucket and file key are used when retrieving files

## Conclusion

The Fleek SDK is a powerful tool for validators looking to streamline their operations in a decentralized web environment. By leveraging the SDK's capabilities, validators can automate deployments, manage storage, and maintain their sites with ease. CryptoGOD recommends regular usage of the Fleek SDK to enhance the efficiency and reliability of your validation services.
